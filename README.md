# wiki-brain

A source-grounded, longitudinal knowledge graph and cognitive modeling system.
It archives raw evidence about a person and the world that produced them, turns
that evidence into atomic facts, events, entities, relationships, patterns and
higher-order syntheses, and gives an LLM persistent context for reasoning over
it — **without collapsing evidence, interpretation and inference into the same
layer.**

## State: rebuilding

The original working tree was wiped. This repository is being reconstituted
from the surviving copies, and **[`RECOVERY.md`](RECOVERY.md)** is the tested
map of what survived, where, and how faithfully — every claim in it was
checked, not assumed.

The short version:

- **The message corpus is fully recoverable.** It was re-pulled from the
  backing sheet and verified byte-exact against `corpus/manifest.json`. No
  time fidelity is at risk on the message record.
- **The engine survived.** `app.py` and all 40 original `bin/` tools are
  byte-exact on the Drive staging copy. Only `.md` files were damaged by that
  copy's Google Docs conversion — a narrower loss than first believed.
- **The wiki body is waiting on a push from the Mac.** That copy is real
  Markdown with real git history, and it is worth more than any
  reconstruction. See [`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md).

The architecture, tooling and knowledge base described below are already in
place and working.

## The constitutional law

```
RAW DATA → STRUCTURED FACT → INTERPRETATION → SYNTHESIS.  NEVER THE REVERSE.
```

Its mechanical form, checked on every build:

> **A node may cite only nodes at a strictly lower layer.**

That single rule is what stops a conclusion from becoming a premise. Without it
someone writes "the relationship was abusive" on a synthesis page, and months
later an event page quotes it as though it were observed at the time — the
interpretation has silently become a fact and the evidence that would let anyone
check it is gone. The failure always runs downward, so the rule is directional,
and `bin/wb-validate` fails the build rather than trusting anyone to be careful.

It also makes the citation graph a DAG with layers as topological levels, so
tracing any conclusion to its evidence terminates, and a citation cycle cannot
be written at all.

## The six layers

| L | Layer | What it is | Mutable? |
| :-- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0** | `source` | Raw material as acquired | **Never.** Append-only |
| **1** | `datum` | One claim, one thing, one time, known provenance | Corrigible |
| **2** | `entity` `event` `relationship` | Structured objects assembled from data | Corrigible |
| **3** | `interpretation` `contradiction` | What it might mean. Someone's reading | Freely revised |
| **4** | `pattern` | Recurrence across layer ≤3 | Freely revised |
| **5** | `synthesis` | Cross-domain model | Freely revised |

Mutability runs opposite to altitude, deliberately. The higher a node sits, the
more disposable it is: an LLM's synthesis is the most disposable thing in the
system, and the source it rests on is the least.

Full design: **[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

## Tools

```sh
bin/wb-validate                    # schema + the layer invariant
bin/wb-build                       # compile to site/ + graph.json + llms.txt
bin/wb-check-publish               # refuse to publish sensitive material
bin/wb-query "why did X happen"    # layered retrieval, not a dump
tests/test-invariant               # 15 regression tests on the invariant
```

Standard library only — no dependencies, no build step, no database. Nodes are
Markdown with TOML frontmatter: machine-readable head, human-readable body,
neither destroying the other.

Relations between nodes are **typed edges**, grouped into six families in
[`schema/edges.json`](schema/edges.json). Edges may point in any direction —
only `cites` is layer-constrained, because only `cites` claims to be evidence —
but every edge must declare how hard it is, what it rests on and who asserts it,
so a stated claim and a model's guess can never look alike. One of the families
is **narrative** (`mythologized`, `performed_as`, `disavowed`, `reframed`,
`retold_as`), which lets the record hold *how a thing was told* separately from
what it was. See [Typed edges](ARCHITECTURE.md#typed-edges).

```markdown
+++
id         = "evt:2026-09-08-rebuild-begins"
layer      = 2
type       = "event"
title      = "Rebuild on the six-layer architecture begins"
cites      = ["dat:0006-drive-copy-lossy"]
confidence = "high"

[when]
date = "2026-09-08"
+++

Prose for humans. The frontmatter is for machines.
```

## What the system refuses to do

- **Resolve contradictions automatically.** Both claims are preserved, dated and
  attributed. "The historical record is ambiguous" beats invented certainty.
- **Let synthesis mutate sources.** Concluding something adds an L3 node; it does
  not rewrite the events underneath.
- **Flatten hindsight onto the past.** If the subject believed "everything is
  fine" during a period later remembered as disastrous, both are kept.
- **Treat absence as evidence of absence.** Negative data is typed:
  `never_observed`, `explicitly_rejected` and `known_not_to_occur` are three
  different claims.
- **Confuse whose reading a claim is.** Every interpretation declares a
  `perspective` — `self`, `external`, `llm` or `other` — so "Dan believes X about
  himself, but the longitudinal record suggests Y" is expressible rather than a
  distinction that quietly disappears.

## Privacy

**This repository is public**, and the message corpus is not the subject's data
alone — it holds the phone numbers, addresses and private words of 498 other
people who did not choose to be published.

So the split is deliberate and enforced in three places:

- `.gitignore` keeps `corpus/messages.csv`, `corpus/private/` and the shelf
  contents out of git, whose history is permanent and searchable.
- `bin/wb-build` excludes any node marked `sensitive = true`, and the citations
  pointing at it — but *declares* the exclusion rather than hiding it, so a
  partial evidence trail never looks complete.
- `bin/wb-check-publish` runs before deploy and asserts the exclusion actually
  happened, against the built output rather than the source.

One thing worth stating plainly, because it is easy to conflate: **the gitignore
is not what protects this data.** The Google Sheet backing the corpus is
deliberately shared "anyone with the link" — a decision on the record, not an
oversight, documented in [`corpus/README.md`](corpus/README.md). Keeping the
corpus out of git history matters on its own terms. It does not narrow who can
reach the sheet. Two separate exposures; one of them is closed.

## Message evidence

[`CORPUS_POLICY.md`](CORPUS_POLICY.md) governs what counts as message evidence.
The complete export — 192,140 messages, 2011-03-19 → 2026-09-07, 577 threads,
498 counterparties — is authoritative. Every earlier per-counterparty extract is
shelved: retained as evidence of what was believed and why it was wrong, never
as evidence of what happened.

```sh
bin/corpus-verify                            # integrity against the manifest
bin/corpus-query --who "Name" --context 3    # read it in situ
```

## Migration

[`MIGRATION.md`](MIGRATION.md) tracks what is still to come across, and why the
Google Drive staging copy is not the source it is coming from.

## Roadmap

[`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) is the design record for the planned changes to the
foundational mechanics — personality profile as a retrieval prior, the edge
system rework, image intake with multimodal corroboration, and Google Takeout
ingestion. It is written before the code, because each of those touches the
layer law and the right time to think about that is first.
