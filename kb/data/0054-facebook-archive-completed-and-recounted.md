## The gain is small and it is worth stating exactly

Eleven threads. Against 392 already held, that is 2.8%.

The enumeration was worth running anyway, because before it the archive's
completeness was an assumption. It is now a measurement: the Drive contains no
`message_1` document that has not been fetched, and the walk terminated on a page
with no continuation token rather than on a guess.

## Three wrong answers on the way to it, all mine

This is recorded because the reasoning failed the same way three times and the
failures were not symmetric — each one was confident.

**1. "701 files means substantial new coverage."** Inferred from the file count
without checking content. Wrong: most of the 701 are duplicate copies.

**2. "It is all duplicates."** Inferred after the first 73 fetched files came
back byte-identical to threads already held. Also wrong, and premature — the
first batch happened to be one duplicate copy of the export, which is a property
of the fetch order, not of the archive.

**3. "128 of the 226 unfetched are genuinely new."** Inferred from Drive
`fileSize`: 128 unfetched documents had sizes appearing nowhere among the
fetched set. This was the worst of the three because it looked like evidence.
Drive's `fileSize` for a Google Doc is its internal representation, which differs
between copies of identical text, so size-mismatch carries no information about
content at all. The true answer was 11.

The sha256 dedupe was the only step that produced a fact. Everything before it
was a heuristic that returned a confident number —
[`pat:partial-data-confident-error`](../patterns/partial-data-confident-error.md),
committed three times in twenty minutes by the thing that wrote the pattern.

## The recount, and why the manifest now reports two numbers

The 2026-09-08 manifest said 15,812 messages. Recounting the same files gave
15,558, and 34 threads individually came out lower. Neither count is wrong; they
measure different things.

- **15,823 message blocks** — every message in the archive, counted by the
  separator rule that precedes each one. This is what the old manifest counted.
- **15,558 searchable** — those that parse into speaker, text and date, and are
  therefore visible to `bin/wb-corroborate`.

The 265-message gap is attachment-only posts and messages whose body breaks the
block pattern. It is not archive loss; it is **tool coverage**, and until now
nothing stated it. `MANIFEST.json` now carries both numbers and a `denominator`
field saying in words that a null result is a null over the searchable 15,558.

That is [`dat:0052`](0052-old-wiki-instrument-layer-three-rules.md)'s rule 3
applied to an instrument that did not have it, and the discrepancy is what
forced the issue: an unexplained 254-message difference between two generations
of one file is exactly the shape of a number nobody can audit.

## And rule 2, applied to the manifest itself

`bin/wb-facebook-manifest` now generates it, and **imports the block pattern from
`bin/wb-corroborate` rather than copying it.** The two counts came apart in the
first place because the manifest was written by hand with one regex while the
search ran another. Whatever the search can find is now what the manifest
reports, by construction. If the parser is wrong they are wrong together, which
is recoverable; if they disagree, the manifest describes an archive nobody is
searching, which is not.

## CORRECTED [2026-09-09] — the denominator published above was itself wrong

This node said 15,823 message blocks were "every message in the archive" and
that 15,558 of them were searchable. Both halves of that were wrong, and the
error is the fourth confident wrong answer in this sequence rather than the end
of the run.

**Some messages have no separator rule at all.** Where the export leaves the
counterparty unnamed, it writes a name line and a rule above Dan's messages and
**nothing above theirs** — only text and a timestamp. So a pattern anchored on
the name matched only his side, and the separator count that was supposed to
catch what the pattern missed did not count those messages either. They were
invisible to both numbers.

The archive's true unit is the **timestamp**, which every message carries.

| | |
| ---: | :--- |
| **16,238** | messages in the archive |
| 15,923 | carry attributable text — searchable |
| 297 | timestamp, no text: attachments, stickers, call notices |
| 13 | unheaded in a thread naming more than two participants |
| 5 | empty segments |

Those four numbers sum to 16,238 exactly, and a test asserts it.

**It read as a monologue and it was a dialogue.** 394 messages across five
threads, 381 of them one side of a single 2010–2021 exchange that the manifest
reported as 421 messages, all Dan's, no counterparty. The other person's half
was in the file the whole time.

## The fix, and the line it does not cross

`bin/wb-corroborate` now walks timestamps rather than name headers. Where the
text above a timestamp carries a name header, that is the speaker. Where it does
not, the speaker is the other participant — **inferred, and only ever in a thread
whose header names exactly two.** In a group thread an unheaded message could be
anybody, so it is counted as unattributed and dropped rather than guessed. That
is 13 messages, and they stay dropped.

[`dat:0031`](0031-dui-belongs-to-the-other-speaker.md) is why that line is drawn
there. A guessed speaker is how the prior wiki came to carry another man's DUI as
a fact about its subject, and a parser that fills in speakers to raise its own
coverage number would be repeating it with better manners. `tests/test-census`
now asserts that line is still attributed to Christo Coan, that the unnamed
counterparty's side parses, and that the four buckets balance.

## What this changes about the archive

The searchable total rises from 15,558 to **15,923** — 365 messages, more than
thirty times the eleven threads the whole enumeration added. The fetch was the
smaller half of this work by a wide margin.

Every Facebook search run in this repository before now was run against a corpus
missing one side of five conversations. None of the findings drawn from it
([`dat:0031`](0031-dui-belongs-to-the-other-speaker.md),
[`dat:0033`](0033-2011-suboxone-appointment-with-screening.md),
[`dat:0035`](0035-facebook-fills-the-corpus-gap.md),
[`dat:0045`](0045-facebook-graduation-claim-september-2009.md),
[`dat:0046`](0046-facebook-corroborates-two-ledger-adjudications.md)) turned on
a null in those threads, so none is disturbed — but that is luck, and it was
checked rather than assumed.
