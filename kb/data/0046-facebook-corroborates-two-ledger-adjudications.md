This bears on two entries in the prior wiki's testimony ledger. It independently corroborates the REFUTATION of t002 (\"He moved from Florida to Brooklyn, New York on 3 January 2010\", stated `certain`), which the ledger refuted from the tweet archive alone: on 31 January 2010 he had not moved and expected to move in March. It also independently supports the ledger's reasoning on t014 (\"continuous Suboxone regimen began 17 February 2010\", CONFIRMED from a same-day tweet reading \"this is the most stressful day/decision of my life\"), which excluded the Brooklyn move as the alternative referent on the grounds that it was settled by late January and discussed as good news — the 2010-01-31 message is exactly that, settled and unremarkable, three weeks before the stressful day. Facebook holds 10 messages in February 2010 against a monthly median of 32, which is PARTIAL coverage, and no occurrence of `suboxone` in any year of the window."

Eight claims from the prior wiki have now been checked against independent
channels. Seven changed. **This is the first one that did not.**

## Why it matters more than a confirmation usually would

[`pat:reasoning-sound-provenance-unreliable`](../patterns/reasoning-sound-provenance-unreliable.md)
holds that the prior wiki's arguments survive checking and its quotations often
do not. Every instance behind it was found by catching a quotation out. A pattern
supported only by its own failures is a pattern with no denominator, and this is
the denominator: an adjudication checked against a channel the wiki did not hold,
which came back intact.

The t014 half is the stronger of the two. Corroborating a *verdict* is cheap —
two channels can agree because both record the same easily-recorded fact.
Corroborating an *exclusion* is not. The ledger argued that a 2010-02-17 tweet
about "the most stressful day/decision of my life" could not be about the
Brooklyn move, because that decision was already made and was being discussed
cheerfully. It reasoned that from the tweet archive. A different archive, fetched
sixteen years later from a different company, shows him on 31 January discussing
the move in a flat aside about catching up. The reasoning held against evidence
it was not built on.

## What is not established

The 2010-01-31 message says nothing about Suboxone, and nothing in the Facebook
export does, in any year. February 2010 is PARTIAL at 10 messages against a
median of 32, so that silence is `never_observed` and carries no weight either
way. t014 remains what the ledger honestly called it: a dated alignment on an
independent same-day artefact, not a clinical record.

The move date also sharpens by a few days rather than settling. On 31 January he
expected "the first week in March"; the tweets the ledger quotes have him leaving
Florida on 28 February. Both refute 3 January, which is the claim at issue.
