## What the check confirms

The message is real, the operator's, and dated 2025-09-02: Smith as the
positive pole of the listening gate ('real music') is genuine corpus
evidence, not generated metaphor. The date the page gives is correct —
no timezone displacement (06:40 UTC is still Sep 2 in Eastern).

## What the check corrects

The page quotes loosely in two ways that matter. 'trashmusic' as one word
is small, but the elided James Brown clause is the load-bearing one: the
page's version reads as 'R&B bad, Elliott Smith good', while the actual
message lays down a **rule with an exception** — pre-1979 R&B is fine, and
the named exemplar is James Brown Live at the Apollo. The page's reading
('the artist you pivot *to* when the overproduced stuff gets cut') is
consistent with the full text, but the full text is richer: the gate is
about production era, not genre. File the page's quote as a paraphrase with
an ellipsis, not a verbatim quote.
