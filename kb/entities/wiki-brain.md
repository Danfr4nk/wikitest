## Summary

A source-grounded longitudinal knowledge graph and cognitive modeling system.
Archives raw evidence about a person and their world, transforms it into atomic
facts, events, entities, relationships, patterns and syntheses, and gives an LLM
persistent context — without collapsing evidence, interpretation and inference
into the same layer.

Projects are longitudinal entities. This one has had at least two architectures:
a plain-markdown wiki compiled by an LLM, and the layered graph specified in
`src:conceptual-spec-2026` and built here.
