# RECOVERY.md

What can be recovered, from where, and how faithfully. Every claim below was
tested in this session rather than assumed. Delete this file when the rebuild
is complete.

## The constraint that shapes everything

This session runs in an **ephemeral cloud container**, not on the Mac. The
four sources named at kickoff are all local paths, and none of them are
reachable from here:

| Path | Status |
| :--- | :----- |
| `/Users/daniel/Desktop/messages.csv` | Not reachable — no `/Users` on this host |
| `/Users/daniel/Desktop/wiki-brain-backup-20260907` | Not reachable |
| `/Volumes/MUSIC/alias/XXX/wiki-brain-main-1` | Not reachable — no `/Volumes` |
| `/Volumes/MUSIC/wiki-brain2` | Not reachable |
| `/Volumes/MUSIC/TAKEOUT` | Not reachable |

Those clones are the best copies that exist — real files on a real
filesystem, with git history. Nothing below is a substitute for them. What
follows is what can be reached *without* them.

## Verified: the corpus is 100% recoverable

The single most important result. The corpus was re-downloaded in this
session from the backing sheet and **matches `manifest.json` byte for byte**:

```
sheet    1WxR14bXRcBS6uyrSk4ZVsoyuu9EUE_l6LC3ruaK7ouA
bytes    48,004,305          (manifest: 48,004,305)   ✅
sha256   2c53c540…9d98cbb    (manifest: 2c53c540…9d98cbb)  ✅
rows     192,140 messages, 2011-03-19 → 2026-09-07
```

No credentials were used or needed — the sheet is shared "anyone with the
link", which is the documented, deliberate decision recorded in the old
`corpus/README.md`. That decision is why this recovery worked. It is noted
here as a recovery fact, not reopened as a question.

**Consequence: no time fidelity is at risk on the message record.** The
corpus can be re-pulled at any moment, on any machine, and verified against
the manifest. It is the one piece of this system that cannot be lost.

## Verified: the entire engine survived byte-exact on Drive

`MIGRATION.md` warned that the Drive staging copy is lossy because "every
`.md` file was converted to a Google Doc on upload." That is true — **and it
is only true of `.md` files.** Everything else was stored as raw bytes and
comes back exactly as it went in.

Confirmed intact in Drive folder `wiki-brain-main-1`
(`10TlQoROslpR99NroxuSQa9mMH_X2nul9`):

| Item | Size | Drive mime | Fidelity |
| :--- | :--- | :--------- | :------- |
| `app.py` | 116,273 B | `text/x-python` | byte-exact |
| `bin/` — 40 scripts | ~1 MB total | `octet-stream` / `text/x-python` | byte-exact |
| `_config.yml` | 747 B | `octet-stream` | byte-exact ✅ restored |
| `.gitignore` | 931 B | `octet-stream` | byte-exact ✅ restored |
| `Wiki.command`, `Capture.command` | small | `x-shellscript` | byte-exact |
| `TWITTER_PULL.prompt`, `PLAIN_AGENT.prompt` | 14.8 KB / 1.3 KB | `octet-stream` | byte-exact |

The `bin/` toolchain is complete — including `build-site` (49 KB), `intake`
(111 KB), `wiki-crosslink` (100 KB), `wiki-testimony` (67 KB), `wiki-lint`,
`wiki-timeline`, `wiki-traits`, `mine-messages`, `psychometrics`,
`export-corpus`, `verify-master`, `aesgcm.py` and 28 others.

**The machine that builds the wiki is not lost.** Only its contents are at
risk.

## Verified: how badly the `.md` pages were damaged

Tested by round-tripping `wiki/people/vaughn.md` (11.6 KB) out of Drive as
`text/markdown`. The result is better than feared in the body and worse than
feared in the head:

**Survived intact**
- All body prose, including em-dashes, smart quotes and emoji
- Headings, bold, italics, blockquotes
- **Markdown tables** — fully preserved, pipes and alignment rows included
- Line breaks between list items

**Damaged, mechanically repairable**
- Backslash escapes injected throughout: `\_`, `\[`, `\]`, `\.`, `\~`
- Wikilinks became `\[\[wiki/people/jack-rusko|Jack Rusko\]\]` — correct
  target and label, just escaped. Unescaping restores them.

**Damaged, genuinely lossy**
- **YAML frontmatter line breaks are gone.** Plain key/value pairs were
  flattened into one run-on paragraph:
  `domain: people page\_type: entity status: closed knowledge: mixed
  date\_created: 2026-06-23 …`
  List-valued keys (`sources:`, `connections:`) kept their line breaks, so
  the nested structure partly survives. Re-splitting the flattened keys is
  possible because the key vocabulary is finite and known, but it is
  inference, not restoration, and it will mis-split any value that contains
  a colon.

So: **bodies are recoverable to near-original quality; frontmatter is
reconstructed rather than recovered.** For a system whose constitutional
rule is "never let inference masquerade as evidence," rebuilding a thousand
frontmatter blocks by inference is exactly the wrong foundation to pour.

## Scale of the wiki body

| Area | Observed |
| :--- | :------- |
| `wiki/` subject dirs | 12 — `work timeline self places people mind meta interests legal health assets .obsidian` |
| `wiki/people/` | 100+ pages (paginated; full count not yet enumerated) |
| Whole tree | 1,000+ files per `MIGRATION.md` |
| Wikilinks | ~3,150 per the `_config.yml` comment |

## The second constraint: bulk transfer is throttled

Drive files can only be pulled through the authenticated connector, one file
per call, with the bytes passing through the agent's context. Unauthenticated
direct download is blocked by this environment's sandbox. At 1,000+ files
that is not a viable bulk path — it is fine for tens of files, not thousands.

This is what makes the Mac push worth more than any amount of cleverness
here.

## Recommended order

1. **Push the real clone from the Mac.** Byte-exact, keeps git history, and
   makes every "lossy" row above irrelevant. The procedure is already
   written in the old repo's `MIGRATION.md` (`--allow-unrelated-histories`,
   union the `.gitignore`, merge the `README.md` — **do not force-push**).
   If the folder was never a git repo, zip it and share the link instead.
2. **Pull `bin/` and `app.py` from Drive.** Byte-exact, ~41 files, viable
   through the connector. Do this if the Mac push stalls — it restores the
   engine independently of the content.
3. **Re-pull the corpus** and `bin/corpus-verify` against the manifest.
4. **Only then** consider Drive `.md` reconstruction, and only for pages the
   Mac copy turns out not to have.

## Status

| Piece | State |
| :---- | :---- |
| Corpus | **Verified recoverable** — byte-exact, re-pullable on demand |
| `_config.yml` | **Restored** — byte-exact |
| `.gitignore` | **Restored** — byte-exact, unioned with corpus rules |
| `bin/` + `app.py` | Reachable byte-exact on Drive, not yet pulled |
| Wiki body (`wiki/`, `raw/`, governing docs) | **Waiting on a push from the Mac** |
| `/Volumes/MUSIC/TAKEOUT` | Not reachable; ingestion design deferred |
